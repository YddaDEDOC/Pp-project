  	<p>Welcome to my website! Now if you have some experience with either web development or learned programming you might have a good understanding of what is going on, and might even understand most of what I will be teaching. But donâ€™t worry! Cause the web is massive and so is programming! But if you think you have sufficient prior general knowledge about what coding, you can skip to the individual tutorials about different markup languages. And as for those who have no idea what is going on, this main page is all for you! Below is a Q & A for all types of beginners! (if you are clueless we highly recommend looking at the Q&A)</p>
