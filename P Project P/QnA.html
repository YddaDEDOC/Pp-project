  	<h2>What is this website about?</h2>
    <p>In simpler terms, this website is all about coding - teaching different languages with different interactive methods! A more in-depth explanation would be that this website will teach you exactly 2 programming languages, 2 markup languages and give some insight to cyber cryptography, hosting servers / API's etc. If this all seems a bit overwhelming, don’t worry because it will be taught from a super-beginners perspective, even though markup languages are far easier as they do not interpret any type of logic, but I believe they would be misleading to new leaners, and if you are looking for a starting point u would recommend my python tutorial. Don’t worry though, in the course selection page I have given a recommended order to be taken and also a difficulty for each course.</p>
